    "task_description": "You are provided with the following network description and its current state:\nNetwork Description: An enterprise hierarchical network using OSPF with multiple areas, built from three core routers, distribution routers, and bridged access switches.User hosts sit in subnets of the form 10.<core>.<dist>.0/24, obtain their IP configuration via DHCP (with dist-layer DHCP relay to a central DHCP server), and reach a server farm in 10.200.0.0/24 that hosts a DNS server for the local zone, several Apache web servers (web0.local\u2026web3.local), An Nginx HTTP load balancer published as web99.local, which load-balances requests to three backend web servers.Note that by design the backend web servers should not be directly accessible from the hosts. All infrastructure and server networks are advertised by FRR OSPF so that hosts can resolve and access the web services end-to-end.\nSwitches: switch_access_1_1_1, switch_access_2_1_1\nHosts: host_1_1_1_1, host_2_1_1_1\nDns Servers: dns_server\nWeb Servers: web_server_0, web_server_1, web_server_2, web_server_3\nLoad_balancer Servers: load_balancer\nDhcp Servers: dhcp_server\nRouters (FRRRouting): router_core_1, router_core_2, router_core_3, router_dist_1_1, router_dist_2_1, server_access_router\nTopology: (load_balancer:eth1, backend_web_0:eth0), (router_core_1:eth0, router_core_2:eth0), (router_core_1:eth1, router_core_3:eth0), (router_core_1:eth2, router_dist_1_1:eth0), (router_core_2:eth1, router_core_3:eth1), (router_core_2:eth2, router_dist_2_1:eth0), (router_core_3:eth2, server_access_router:eth7), (router_dist_1_1:eth1, switch_access_1_1_1:eth0), (router_dist_2_1:eth1, switch_access_2_1_1:eth0), (dhcp_server:eth0, server_access_router:eth6), (dns_server:eth0, server_access_router:eth0), (load_balancer:eth0, server_access_router:eth5), (web_server_0:eth0, server_access_router:eth1), (web_server_1:eth0, server_access_router:eth2), (web_server_2:eth0, server_access_router:eth3), (web_server_3:eth0, server_access_router:eth4), (switch_access_1_1_1:eth1, host_1_1_1_1:eth0), (switch_access_2_1_1:eth1, host_2_1_1_1:eth0)\n\nYour goal is to analyze the network condition and, if needed, use the available tools.\nYou need to generate a troubeshooting diagnosis report.\nThe report should reflect your assessment of the network's health, indicate any abnormal behavior you identify, and describe relevant findings based on your analysis.\n\nFocus on producing an informative and coherent diagnostic report derived from the network state.\nDo not need to propose any solutions or remediation steps at this stage.",
