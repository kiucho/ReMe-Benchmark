    "task_description": "You are provided with the following network description and its current state:\nNetwork Description: A 4-tier data center Clos (super-spine, spine, leaf, service hosts) using EBGP: all inter-router links are /31s from 172.16.0.0/16, and each leaf connects to one service subnet 10.<pod>.<idx>.0/24 that it advertises via BGP.Each pod runs one DNS server (Bind, authoritative for zone podX) and several HTTP web servers; DNS provides A records like web0.pod0 pointing to the web servers, which run python3 -m http.server on port 80.External client hosts sit in 192.168.<pod>.0/24 networks, use the pod DNS servers in /etc/resolv.conf, and access the services via URLs such as http://web0.pod0 over the routed Clos fabric.\nHosts: client_0\nDns Servers: dns_pod0\nWeb Servers: webserver0_pod0\nRouters (FRRRouting): leaf_router_0_0, leaf_router_0_1, spine_router_0_0, spine_router_0_1, super_spine_router_0\nTopology: (leaf_router_0_0:eth2, dns_pod0:eth0), (leaf_router_0_1:eth2, webserver0_pod0:eth0), (spine_router_0_0:eth1, leaf_router_0_0:eth0), (spine_router_0_0:eth2, leaf_router_0_1:eth0), (spine_router_0_1:eth1, leaf_router_0_0:eth1), (spine_router_0_1:eth2, leaf_router_0_1:eth1), (super_spine_router_0:eth2, client_0:eth0), (super_spine_router_0:eth0, spine_router_0_0:eth0), (super_spine_router_0:eth1, spine_router_0_1:eth0)\n\nYour goal is to analyze the network condition and, if needed, use the available tools.\nYou need to generate a troubeshooting diagnosis report.\nThe report should reflect your assessment of the network's health, indicate any abnormal behavior you identify, and describe relevant findings based on your analysis.\n\nFocus on producing an informative and coherent diagnostic report derived from the network state.\nDo not need to propose any solutions or remediation steps at this stage.",
